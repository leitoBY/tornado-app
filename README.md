# tornado-app
tornado web-app, sqlalchemy

1. install requirements.
``` pip install requirements -r```
2. run server
``` python server.py ```

By default application listen to 8888 port, and looks for a mysql database named app, which is on localhost:3306 default mysql port. Later i'll move it to config params sure =)
